		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr>
		<br>
		<p>I am Naryn Samuel from Saint Lucia, and currently attend Northern Kentucky Univeristy. My major is Business Information Systems, and I have a minor in General Business and Accounting. This is my personal website, and here you can get to know a lot about me. You can find my resume and academic work, listen to my guitar recordings and read about my favourite soccer team. There is also a page where you can reach me and find my contact information.</p>
